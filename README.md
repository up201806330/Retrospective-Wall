## Product Vision
A place where conference attendees can express their satisfaction with the different aspects of the conference, giving feedback to the organizers in real time, through an intuitive, interactive and interesting interface.

---
## Elevator Pitch
Have you ever faced any issue in an online conference but didn't know where or who to transmit them to or even found the process difficult and time-consuming?
We are the Esoterics and our work focus on exactly that: provide a straight-forward way to deliver the atendees' feedback to the organizers, by streamlining the gathering of points of view from the participants via the feedback bubbles. By simply creating a feedback bubble, commenting on an existing issue or even by just pointing out positives of an event, anyone taking part can express their opinion on the event(s) and therefore empowering the people in charge to perform on the fly adjustments to fix the issues that get reported, improving the experience of all parties involved.

<!-- 
Draft a small text to help you quickly introduce and describe your product in a short time and a few words (~800 characters), a technique usually known as elevator pitch.

## Requirements


### Use case diagram 

 
![useCase](./Docs/useCases.png)

#### Like or Dislike Feedback Bubles
* **Actor**. Attendees
* **Description**. Choose to either like or deslike an existing bubble in order to enhance (or not) the feedback credibility. (Liking the bubble will make it grow, while disliking it will make it smaller.
* **Preconditions and Postconditions**. A feedback bubble must exist so that it can be liked/disliked and you need to be logged in.
- **Normal Flow:**
  - User presses like button on the feedback bubble
    - System will make that bubble bigger
  - User presses dislike button on the feedback bubble
    - System will make that bubble smaller
    
#### Creating Feedback Pop-up question
* **Actor**. Metting's host
* **Description**. Host can create questions that pop after the meeting ends in order to get attendees opinion on a specific subject.
* **Preconditions and Postconditions**. Metting has to end and you need to be logged in.
- **Normal Flow:** 
 
  - Host creates question
  - System makes it pop up attendees screen.
 
 #### Comenting on Feedback bubbles
* **Actor**. Attendee
* **Description**. Attendees can comment on other's feedback in order to add some information they think might be needed.
* **Preconditions and Postconditions**. Feedback buble must exist  so that it can be commented and you need to be logged in.
- **Normal Flow:**
  - Attendee chooses wich feedback bubble he wants to comment on.
  - Attendee is given a text box to write and an option to phone's gallery if he wishes to add a photo or a gif.
  - Attendee submits his comment.
- **Alternative Flows and Exceptions:** If you leave comment's page wihtout submiting, your draft will get erased.

#### Create Feedback bubble
- **Actor:** Attendee.
- **Description:** The base functionality of the app, the ability to create a bubble describing an issue or idea. These belong to a specific category (*Wishes, Risks, Appreciations, Puzzles*) and may pertain to something more specific inside the event (*a specific talk, branch of the organization, ...*)
- **Preconditions and Postconditions:** You must be logged in.
- **Normal Flow:**
  - User provides a title.
  - User chooses category from drop-down list.
  - User chooses if the feedback is anonymous.
  - User provides a description of the feedback. 
  - User submits form and bubble is created
- **Alternative Flows and Exceptions:** The user can leave the creation process *midway through*, which will cancel the creation of the feedback



### User stories

Our user stories are listed on the [project board](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t5g2-esotericos/projects/1), along with their UI Mockups and Gherkin acceptance tests.

<!-- 
This section will contain the requirements of the product described as **user stories**, organized in a global **[user story map](https://plan.io/blog/user-story-mapping/)** with **user roles** or **themes**.

For each theme, or role, you may add a small description. User stories should be detailed in the tool you decided to use for project management (e.g. trello or github projects).

A user story is a description of desired functionality told from the perspective of the user or customer. A starting template for the description of a user story is  
-->

***

<!-- 
**INVEST in good user stories**. 
You may add more details after, but the shorter and complete, the better. In order to decide if the user story is good, please follow the [INVEST guidelines](https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/).


**User interface mockups**.

After the user story text, you should add a draft of the corresponding user interfaces, a simple mockup or draft, if applicable. 


![First look of the Wall](./Docs/UI_1.png)

**Acceptance tests**.
For each user story you should write also the acceptance tests (textually in Gherkin), i.e., a description of scenarios (situations) that will help to confirm that the system satisfies the requirements addressed by the user story.

**Value and effort**.
At the end, it is good to add a rough indication of the value of the user story to the customers (e.g. [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) method) and the team should add an estimation of the effort to implement it, for example, using t-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL). -->

### Domain model

![Domain Model](./Docs/domain.png)

---

## Architecture and Design

### Logical architecture
![Logical Architecture](./Docs/logicalArchitecture.png)
Like most projects of this nature usually do, we adopted the *MVC* pattern. A central "Controller" is in charge of receiving inputs from the user and updating the corresponding model, which in turn triggers changes in the view of this component.

### Physical architecture
![Physical Architecture](./Docs/physicalArchitecture.png)
Architecturally, our project is split in two parts: 
- The **Client side**, which consists of both the *Attendee* and the *Organization* apps.
- The **Server side**, where the *Firebase* database lives and stores all users' data .

The technologies we chose were *Flutter*, so in the end it would be easier to merge with the **open-cx** project and our class' work, and *Firebase*, since it fit well into our needs and would be simpler than handling the *back-end* ourselves.  
The *FlutterFire* library's components take care of all the communication with the database, and this ease of mind was a major deciding factor for us.


## Implementation
<!-- 
Regular product increments are a good practice of product management. 

While not necessary, sometimes it might be useful to explain a few aspects of the code that have the greatest potential to confuse software engineers about how it works. Since the code should speak by itself, try to keep this section as short and simple as possible.

Use cross-links to the code repository and only embed real fragments of code when strictly needed, since they tend to become outdated very soon.

## Test

To test the behaviour of our app's features, we implemented acceptance tests using the **_gherkin_** package. These tests are divided in two parts, the features and the steps. The features are described in **.feature** files using certain keywords, like *Given*, *When* and *Then* and also using natural language. The steps are defined in the **Dart** language and are responsible for performing certain actions described in the features.
We have implemented automated acceptance tests for most important features of our application, like the following:
* Creation of feedback bubbles
* Hiding the identity of the user upon feedback bubble creation
* Liking and disliking other people's feedback bubbles
* Seeing the list of bubbles of a certain category

In order to develop these tests, the **_gherkin_** package was used to write the test scenarios and the **_flutter_driver_** package was also used in the steps' implementation.

Here are some screenshots of the tests:
![Categories test](./Docs/acceptance_test_categories.png "Categories test passed")

![User identity test](./Docs/acceptance_test_anonymous.png "User identity test passed")

![Create bubble test](./Docs/acceptance_tests_create_bubble.png "Create bubble test passed")

![New bubble navigation test](./Docs/acceptance_test_new_bubble.png "New bubble navigation test passed")

![Liking test](./Docs/acceptance_test_like.png "Liking test passed")

![Disliking test](./Docs/acceptance_test_dislike.png "Disliking test passed")

## Configuration and change management

<!-- 
Configuration and change management are key activities to control change to, and maintain the integrity of, a project’s artifacts (code, models, documents).

For the purpose of ESOF, we will use a very simple approach, just to manage feature requests, bug fixes, and improvements, using GitHub issues and following the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

In addition we used [github actions](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t5g2-esotericos/actions) to automate generation of png from plantuml files.

## Project management


<!-- 
Software project management is an art and science of planning and leading software projects, in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored and controlled.

In the context of ESOF, we expect that each team adopts a project management tool capable of registering tasks, assign tasks to people, add estimations to tasks, monitor tasks progress, and therefore being able to track their projects.

Example of tools to do this are:
  * [Trello.com](https://trello.com)
  * [Github Projects](https://github.com/features/project-management/com)
  * [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com)
  * [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)

We recommend to use the simplest tool that can possibly work for the team.
 -->

During the development of this project we used Github Projects to estimate the workload, to keep track of what was yet to be finished, in progress or already done and who were the responsibles for each task and.
See our progress through our [project board](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t5g2-esotericos/projects/1).
